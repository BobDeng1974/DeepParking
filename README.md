# üöò DeepParking
## _Find the closest vacant parking spot, every time._

**DeepParking** is an _open-source solution_ for detecting vacant parking spots in indoor parking garages, and delivering real-time notifications to nearby drivers. Low-cost cameras are mounted throughout garages and mapped to locations of available parking spaces. State-of-the-art deep learning algorithms detect occupied spaces, and write the results to a Redis cache. As drivers enter the garage, they are routed to closest available free parking space.

With **DeepParking**, you'll never have to waste time hunting for a parking spot again!

### üìñ Technical Stack

**DeepParking** prides itself on being a 100% open-source solution, from algorithm to web application.

#### [Web Application](https://github.com/DeepParking/DeepParking/tree/master/web)
Angular CLI version 6.0.8.

#### [Deep Learning: Object Detection]((https://github.com/DeepParking/DeepParking/tree/master/web))
Leverages the state-of-the-art [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) v3 real-time object detection system.

#### [Scalable Deployment](https://github.com/DeepParking/DeepParking/tree/master/spots_api)
Docker, Kubernetes, Redis.

### üìπ Hardware Configuration

For optimal results with **DeepParking**, we recommend using a camera configuration similar to the one shown below. No more than five parking spots should be visible for any single captured frame; a single camera with one degree of rotation can be used to monitor 10 parking spots. It is recommended that an image for each 5-space frame is captured every 15 to 20 seconds.

Estimated cost for 100-car garage: $150
