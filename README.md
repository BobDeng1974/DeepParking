## _Find Vacant Parking Spots_

**DeepParking** is an _open-source solution_ for detecting vacant parking spots in indoor parking garages, and delivering realtime notifications to nearby drivers. Low-cost cameras are mounted throughout garages and mapped to locations of available parking spaces. As drivers enter the garage, they are routed to closest available free parking space.
