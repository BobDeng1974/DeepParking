# üöò DeepParking
## _Find the closest vacant parking spot, every time._

**DeepParking** is an _open-source solution_ for detecting vacant parking spots in indoor parking garages, and delivering real-time notifications to nearby drivers. Low-cost cameras are mounted throughout garages and mapped to locations of available parking spaces. State-of-the-art deep learning algorithms detect occupied spaces, and write the results to a Redis cache. As drivers enter the garage, they are routed to closest available free parking space.

With **DeepParking**, you'll never have to waste time hunting for a parking spot again!

### üìπ Hardware Configuration

For optimal results with **DeepParking**, we recommend using a camera configuration similar to the one shown below. No more than five parking spots should be visible for any single captured frame; a single camera with one degree of rotation can be used to monitor 10 parking spots. It is recommended that an image for each 5-space frame is captured every 15 to 20 seconds.

Estimated cost for 100-car garage: $150

### Usage

DeepPark is made up of the following components:

* Camera Gateway API - Receives images from cameras, performs vacant spot analysis on the images and pushes the results to Redis
* Spots API - External facing API that is used by the Web App to provide vacant parking spots info
* Web App - A web application for drivers that shows information about vacant parking spots
* Redis - stores results about parking areas, cameras and vacant spots for realtime querying

In order to set-up an environment locally, edit the area.json file that contains metadata about the parking lot and start a local Redis instance. <br>
Run the Python setup script:

```
$ python3 ./setup/setup_area.py --redis-host=localhost
```

The same script can be run on any accessible redis host to set-up the environment.

### Running on Kubernetes

DeepPark runs natively on Kubernetes.
To install DeepPark, simply run:

```
$ kubectl create -f ./setup/kubernetes
```

Thats it!
Wait for the following deployments to appear as running:

* camera-gateway-deployment
* camera-tester-deployment
* redis-deployment
* spots-deployment


##### Get the External IP of the camera tester:

```
$ kubectl get svc camera-tester-svc
```


##### Get the External IP of the camera tester:

```
$ kubectl get svc camera-tester-svc
```

The Camera Tester App will ask for the address of the Camera Gateway API.
Get it with:

```
$ kubectl get svc camera-gateway-svc
```

*Note: The Camera Gateway API uses port 8080.*


###### Get the External IP of the driver app:

```
$ kubectl get svc driver-app-svc
```
