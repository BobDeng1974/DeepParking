# üöò DeepParking
## _Find the closest vacant parking spot, every time._

**DeepParking** is an _open-source solution_ for detecting vacant parking spots in indoor parking garages, and delivering real-time notifications to nearby drivers. Low-cost cameras are mounted throughout garages and mapped to locations of available parking spaces. State-of-the-art deep learning algorithms detect occupied spaces, and write the results to a Redis cache. As drivers enter the garage, they are routed to closest available free parking space.

With **DeepParking**, you'll never have to waste time hunting for a parking spot again!
